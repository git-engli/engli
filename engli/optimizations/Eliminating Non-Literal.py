Eliminating non-literal language, such as idioms, metaphors, and figurative expressions, is essential for creating an optimized version of English for AI processing. Such language can be ambiguous and confusing for AI due to its reliance on cultural and contextual understanding. The goal is to identify these non-literal expressions and replace them with their literal meanings or remove them if they don't contribute essential information.

Strategies for Eliminating Non-literal Language:
Identify Figurative Expressions: Detect idioms, metaphors, and other non-literal language in the text.
Replace with Literal Equivalents: Substitute non-literal expressions with their literal meanings.
Remove Unnecessary Figurative Language: If a non-literal expression doesn't add essential information, remove it.
Advanced Python Scripts for Eliminating Non-literal Language:

1. Identify Figurative Expressions:
We'll use spaCy with custom rules to identify common idiomatic or figurative expressions.


import spacy
from spacy.matcher import Matcher

nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)

# Define patterns for common idiomatic expressions
patterns = [
    [{"LOWER": "hit"}, {"LOWER": "the"}, {"LOWER": "books"}],  # Example for "hit the books"
    [{"LOWER": "spill"}, {"LOWER": "the"}, {"LOWER": "beans"}],  # Example for "spill the beans"
    # Add more patterns as needed
]
matcher.add("IDIOMS", patterns)

def identify_idioms(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    matches = matcher(doc)
    idioms = [doc[start:end].text for _, start, end in matches]
    return idioms

# Example usage
text = "He decided to hit the books."
idioms = identify_idioms(text)
print("Identified idiomatic expressions:", idioms)

2. Replace with Literal Equivalents:
Create a dictionary mapping idiomatic expressions to their literal meanings.


# Mapping idioms to their literal meanings
idiom_meanings = {
    "hit the books": "start studying",
    "spill the beans": "reveal the secret",
    # Add more mappings
}

def replace_idioms(text):
    idioms = identify_idioms(text)
    for idiom in idioms:
        if idiom in idiom_meanings:
            text = text.replace(idiom, idiom_meanings[idiom])
    return text

# Example usage
text = "It's time to hit the books."
literal_text = replace_idioms(text)
print(literal_text)
3. Remove Unnecessary Figurative Language:
If an idiom doesnâ€™t contribute essential meaning, it can be removed.


def remove_non_essential_idioms(text):
    idioms = identify_idioms(text)
    for idiom in idioms:
        text = text.replace(idiom, "")
    return text

# Example usage
text = "When he heard the news, he spilled the beans."
clean_text = remove_non_essential_idioms(text)
print(clean_text)

Considerations:
Complexity and Variety of Figurative Language: Figurative language is vast and varied, making it a challenge to capture all idiomatic expressions.
Contextual Dependence: The decision to replace or remove an idiom depends on its context, which can be complex for AI to ascertain.
Continuous Updates: New idioms and expressions emerge regularly, requiring continuous updates to the system.
This framework provides a starting point. However, a fully robust system for eliminating non-literal language would require extensive databases of idioms and their meanings, advanced contextual analysis capabilities, and possibly machine learning techniques to adapt to new expressions and contexts.
