Also, don't forget to deactivate the currently activated Python virtual environment before trying to activate another one.

now keep going and if some commands are requiring variables you put the variables arround *{ and }* like this one : "create a new github repo and push all this folder": r'''
gh repo create *{projectname}* --confirm *{--private or --public}*
git init
#touch readME.md   #this is to create an initial file to push
echo -e 'env\n__pycache__\n.env\nlib64/\nlib/\nshare' > .gitignore
git add .
git commit -m "first"
git remote add origin https://github.com/*{username}*/myproject.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
''',
Absolutely, let's continue with the previously established pattern:

python
Copy code

now keep going with more complex with more variables and answer only the code of complex_bash_commands
Sure thing! Let's keep going with some more complex commands:

python
Copy code

even_more_complex_bash_commands = {
"Create a Docker Swarm": r'''docker swarm init --advertise-addr *{IP_address}*''',

"Deploy a service to Docker Swarm": r'''docker service create --replicas 1 --name *{service}* *{docker_image}*''',

now make many more related to cronjob with variables of every hour every minute every day etc
Sure, here are some cronjob examples with varying schedules:

python
Copy code

cronjob_commands = {
"Run job every minute": r'''crontab -e
* * * * * *{command}*''',

"Run job every 5 minutes": r'''crontab -e
*/5 * * * * *{command}*''',

"Run job every hour": r'''crontab -e
0 * * * * *{command}*''',

"Run job every day at midnight": r'''crontab -e
0 0 * * * *{command}*''',

"Run job on specific minute (5 past every hour)": r'''crontab -e
5 * * * * *{command}*''',

"Run job at a specific time (2:30 PM)": r'''crontab -e
30 14 * * * *{command}*''',

30 14 1 JAN,APR,JUL,OCT * *{command}*''',

"Delete (clear) all crontab jobs": r'''crontab -r''',
}
In these examples, replace {command} with the command you intend to run. The structure of the cron schedule is as follows:

Minutes: 0-59
Hours: 0-23 (0 is midnight)
Day of month: 1-31
Month: 1-12 or JAN-DEC
Day of week: 0-7 (Sunday is 0 or 7), or SUN-SAT
crontab -e is used to open the crontab file for editing and crontab -r is used to delete all cron jobs.

now make some more complex that times can be variables 
Absolutely! Here are few more examples with timing as variables:

python
Copy code

complex_cronjob_commands = {
"Run job every *{n}* minutes": r'''crontab -e
*/{n}* * * * * *{command}*''',

"Run job every *{n}* hours": r'''crontab -e
0 */{n}* * * * *{command}*''',

"Run job every quarter at a specific time (*{h}*: *{m}* AM/PM)": r'''crontab -e
*m* *h* 1 *{month_set}* *{command}*''',
}
In these examples, {n} is the interval for minutes or hours, {command} is the command you want to run, {h} and {m} represent the hours and minutes of the time you want to schedule respectively (in 24-hr format), {month} is the specific month in which you want to run the command (JAN-DEC), {day} is the specific day of the week (SUN-SAT or 0-7, where both 0 and 7 represent Sunday), and {month_set} represents the set of particular months (like JAN,APR,JUL,OCT for each quarter). Make sure to replace these placeholders with the actual values as per your requirements.

now keep going with commands related to creating apps and interacting with Flask
Certainly! Here are some commands related to creating applications and interacting with Flask:

python
Copy code

complex_flask_app_commands = {

Replace {your_flask_app}.py, {port_number}, {module_name}, and {message} with your specific values: Flask app filename, desired port number, your specific module name (which is usually your python file name without extension if it contains your application instance), and migration message respectively. The commands involving installing packages or libraries assume you have pip installed in your Python environment. If you don't, they won't work.

now keep going with related to folders and files and permissions and running scripts with variables
Sure, here are some commands related to file manipulation, folder navigation, permissions, and running scripts:

python
Copy code

file_folder_script_commands = {
"Changing file permissions": r'''chmod *{permission_numbers}* *{file}*''',

"Changing directory permissions": r'''chmod *{permission_numbers}* *{directory}*''',

"Reading from a file": r'''cat *{file}*''',

"Running a Python script with arguments": r'''python3 *{script}* *{arg1}* *{arg2}*...'''
}
Here, {permission_numbers} are the numeric representations of permissions for a file or directory that you want to set. {username} represents the username you want to set as the owner of a file or directory. {interpreter} is the interpreter (like python, bash, etc.) that you want to use to run your script. {your_script} is the script you want to run.

Replace {directory_name}, {file_name}, {source}, {destination}, {directory}, {text}, {file}, {script}, {arg1} and {arg2} with your specific directory name, file name, source and destination paths, directory path, text to write, file from which to read, python script name, and script arguments respectively.

"Check which Python packages are outdated": r'''pip list --outdated''',

"Update all Python packages": r'''pip freeze | cut -d = -f 1 | xargs -n1 pip install -U'''
}
In these examples, you need to replace {file}, {search_string}, {directory}, {n}, {replacement_string}, {archive_name}, {script} with your actual values.

now keep going
Sure, let's continue with some more advanced commands:

python
Copy code

even_more_advanced_commands = {
"Compress a directory excluding some directories": r'''tar -cvzf *{archive_name}.tar.gz* --exclude=*{directory_to_exclude}* *{directory_to_compress}*''',

}
In these examples, replace {archive_name}, {directory_to_exclude}, {directory_to_compress}, {service_name}, {process_name}, {PID}, {username}@{hostname}, {command}, {file}, and {directory} with your respective archive filename, directory to exclude from compression, directory to compress, service name, process name, process ID, SSH user and hostname, command to be executed on remote machine, local filename, and directory in remote machine respectively.

now keep going with related to scraping 
When it comes to scraping, curl and wget are two commonly used command-line tools. However, for more complex scraping tasks, Python libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium are often used. Here are some Bash commands related to simple scraping tasks:

python
Copy code

web_scraping_commands = {
"Fetch the raw HTML content of a webpage": r'''curl *{url}*''',

"Save the HTML content of a webpage to a file": r'''curl *{url}* -o *{filename}*''',

"Download a file from a given URL": r'''wget *{url}*''',

"Download and save with a specific filename": r'''wget -O *{filename}* *{url}*''',

"Crawl website and save for offline viewing": r'''wget --convert-links --mirror --trust-server-names --adjust-extension --span-hosts --backup-converted --page-requisites -P *{save_to}* *{website_url}*'''
}
In these examples, replace {url}, {filename}, {n}, {website_url}, {file_containing_urls.txt}, {save_to} with your desired URL, filename to save the output or downloaded file, number of retry attempts, website URL from which the file or entire website is to be downloaded, text file containing numerous URLs to be downloaded and directory where the website should be saved respectively.

As always, be aware of the legal and ethical implications of web scraping, and always respect the website's rules about robots by checking the site's robots.txt file.

now to it for complex scraping tasks
Complex web scraping tasks often require more advanced tools, such as programming languages coupled with dedicated libraries. Python, accompanied by the BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and Scrapy libraries, is particularly popular for complex scraping tasks.

However, the shell doesn't directly support these tasks, as it is not suitable for handling sessions, cookies, and JavaScript, or parsing HTML content systematically. So, suppose you are using Python for web scraping. In that case, you'll have to manage these tasks using an Interactive Python script executed from the CLI, or with the help of a Python script file. Here are some of the commands you might use in your development environment:

python
Copy code

complex_web_scraping_commands = {
"Install BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML": r'''pip install beautifulsoup4''',

"Install Requests for HTTP requests": r'''pip install requests''',

"Install Selenium for browser automation": r'''pip install selenium''',

"Install the WebDriver for your Browser (e.g., Chrome)": r'''# Must be done manually by downloading the correct driver''',

"Install Scrapy for robust web scraping": r'''pip install Scrapy''',

"Start a new Scrapy project": r'''scrapy startproject *{project_name}*''',

"Generate a Spider for Scrapy project": r'''cd *{project_name}*
scrapy genspider *{spider_name}* *{website}*''',

"Run a Scrapy Spider": r'''scrapy crawl *{spider_name}*''',

"Export Scrapy Spider results to JSON": r'''scrapy crawl *{spider_name}* -o *{results.json}*'''
}
Replace {project_name}, {spider_name}, {website} and {results.json} with your desired name of the Scrapy project, name of the Scrapy spider, the website to be scraped, and the filename to save results in JSON format respectively.

It should be noted that these commands will work in a terminal/CLI supporting Python and pip commands. This interface is not suitable for direct web scraping tasks but is perfect for preparing the environment and executing scraping scripts.

now keep going with complex scraping tasks
For more advanced and complex web scraping tasks, we generally rely on specialized libraries in a programming language like Python. Here's how you might set up and execute some of these tasks using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup4, Scrapy, and Selenium.

First, we install these libraries using pip:

python
Copy code

pip install beautifulsoup4 scrapy selenium pandas
'pandas' is included as it often comes in handy for organizing and cleaning the scraped data.

Next, we write scripts to use these libraries. Here are some examples:

BeautifulSoup example (Saved in a file named bs4_scrape.py):

python
Copy code

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

source = requests.get('*{url}*').text
soup = BeautifulSoup(source, 'lxml')

# Find and print all paragraph text
for p in soup.find_all('p'):
    print(p.get_text())
Scrapy example (Save in a file named scrapy_spider.py within a Scrapy project):

python
Copy code

import scrapy

class BlogSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = '*{spider_name}*'
    start_urls = ['*{starting_url}*']

    def parse(self, response):
        for title in response.css('h2.entry-title'):
            yield {'title': title.css('a ::text').get()}

        for next_page in response.css('div.prev-post > a'):
            yield response.follow(next_page, self.parse)
Selenium example (Saved in a file named selenium_scrape.py):

python
Copy code

from selenium import webdriver

# Initialize webdriver (make sure the chromedriver is in PATH)
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# get source code
driver.get('*{url}*')

# Print the title of the webpage
print(driver.title)

driver.quit()
To execute these scripts, you would use the terminal to call Python and the script file:

python
Copy code

python bs4_scrape.py
python scrapy_spider.py
python selenium_scrape.py
